# Math
A math library for operations with vectors and matrixes.

## Vector package:
In this package we have three classes: Vector2 (a two coordenates vector), Vector3 (a three coordenates vector) and Vector4 (a four coordenates vector). With these classes we can do these basic vectors operations:
 - module of the vector
 - sum of two vectors
 - multiply a vector by a integer
 - deny a vector
 - scalar product of a vector 
 - equals method for two vectors
 - toString method
 - getter and setter
 - crossProduct (only Vector3)

## Matrix package:
In this package we have two classes: Matrix3x3 (a 3x3 matrix) and Matrix4x4 (a 4x4 matrix). With these two classes we can do these basic matrix operations:
 - equals method
 - Sum two matrixes
 - Subtraction of two matrixes
 - Multiply two matrixes
 - Multiply a matrix by a scalar num
 - Division of two matrixes
 - Divide a matrix by a scalar num
 - ToString method
 - Getter and setter
