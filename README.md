# Math
A math library for operations with vectors and matrixes.

## Vector package:
In this package we have three classes: Vector2 (for two coordenates vectors), Vector3 (for three coordenates vectors) and Vector4 (for four coordenates vectors). With these classes we can do these basic vectors operations:
 - Module of the vector.
 - Sum of two vectors.
 - Multiply a vector by a integer.
 - Deny a vector.
 - Scalar product of a vector.
 - Equals method for two vectors.
 - ToString method.
 - Getter and setter.
 - CrossProduct (Vector3 only).

## Matrix package:
In this package we have two classes: Matrix3x3 (for 3x3 matrixes) and Matrix4x4 (for 4x4 matrixes). With these two classes we can do these basic matrix operations:
 - Equals method.
 - Sum two matrixes.
 - Subtraction of two matrixes.
 - Multiply two matrixes.
 - Multiply a matrix by a scalar num.
 - Division of two matrixes.
 - Divide a matrix by a scalar num.
 - ToString method.
 - Getter and setter.
